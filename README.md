## Creating my own admin panel...

  ...to practice some new things like using ~~tailwind css~~ SASS with Grid.

Since I started this project with my own CSS, it was difficult to insert tailwind with the project ongoing. So I preferred to use SASS.
This is my first project with preprocessors/framework. 

Try to ~~combine Vanila CSS and the tailwind things~~ write a scss file with the Vanilla CSS I wrote.

Using specially nesting scss to make it easy to write code.
I'm not using variables at the moment. I'm using root variables for that for now.

### Things learned
#### SASS
 - **@mixin** (to create responsive elements).
 -  **Nested selectors** 
 - **Variables**

#### JavaScript
- **Capture: true** on EventListner to nock click on parents elements with others EventListners

#### Git
- **.gitignore** Setup gitignore for some extentions like *.map.css from SASS.
